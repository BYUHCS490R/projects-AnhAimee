                    Parent child relationship in HTML: the parent element is a bigger box, like a container and child elements are inside the container. 
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                    The relationship is is essential when we use Flex and Grid because Flex and Grid properties are applied to the parent element and the children automatically become flex items or grid items and are arranged according to the parent's layout
                </p>
                <p class="p">
                    Two main differences between CSS grid and CSS flex: layout direction in CSS Grid has 2 dimensional rows and columns but in CSS Flexbox has only one dimensional either row or column. Use case in CSS Grid is best for designing a full page where are can control both rows and columns, whereas CSS Flexbox is best for arranging items in a single line such as bars, bottons, or cards.
