            <h2>Chemical Chacteristics</h2>
                <p>
                    Water molecule consists of 2 hydrogen atoms and covalently bonded to one oxygen atom. The oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the molecular shape is bent. Hence, the oxygen is slightly more negative and hydrogens is more positive. The bond between oxygen and hydrogen is called hydrogen bond.
                </p>
            <h2>Physical Chracteristics</h2>
                <p>
                    Water molecule remains liquid at room temperature. It has high poiling point and melting point due to the strength of hydrogen bonds. Moreover, water has high specific heat capacity, meaning that it can absorb and release large amount of heat with only a small change in temperature. Also, It has high heat of vaporization, which means it requires a lot of energy to change from liquid state to gas state.
                </p>
            <h2>Biological and Enviromental Importance</h2>
                <p>
                    Water is essential for all form of life. It plays a vital role in transfort system such as blood in animal and sap in plant, which carries nutrients, gases, and waste products. Also, water can act as buffer, keeping the enviroment and organisms thermally stable. Additionally, water can participate in chemical reactions, such as photosynthesis.
