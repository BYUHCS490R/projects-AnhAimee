        <h1>My idol - Dr. Christensen Amber</h1>
            <p>Dr. Christensen at BYUH. I have know Dr. Christensen through medical appointments and I always have a good time talking to her. I have learned that she and her husband gratuated from BYU- Hawaii. Then they went for medical school together. Her daughter is my classmate, so she told me many great things about Dr.Christensen. Medical school is very difficult but Christensen family worked toward the degree together, which gives me a lot of motivation to gain my higher degree.</p>
