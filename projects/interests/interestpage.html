        <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <p>Hiking is one of the must do here in Hawaii because it is a combination of mountains, ocean, and historical culture. I love to take a water fall trail hike because I can feel the nature and the trees and water around me. Moreover, while hiking, you would find many wild and domestic species around you, specially different kind of birds and flowers</p>
        <h2>Snorkling</h2>
            <p>Hawaii is one of the best place for snorking because the expererience is unforgetable. The clear blue water allows you to see the colorful fishes and corals, if you are lucky enough, you would see the turtles up close as well. the ocean in hawaii is something very special to me because I feel like home here</p>
        <h2>Links</h2>
            <p>Relative link is filename only, if you want to link to your own domain, use relative link. The reasons that I use relative links because it is simple, easy to use, and easier to organize </p>
