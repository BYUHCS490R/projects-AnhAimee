        <p>These are some places in Hawaii that I have been to. Laie Temple is the must visit when you come to the Northshore. This is the most beautiful temple here in this island. Water fall is a place that you can recharge yourself with nature around you. Art museum is a historical place that I really like because they have many different cultures from all Asia countries. Tide pool and Koko head are the quite dificult hikes but very rewarding.</p>
