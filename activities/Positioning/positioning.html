        <h1>Positioning</h1>
        <p>A lotus is a perennial aquatic plant with large, round leaves that can float or emerge above the water's surface. It is known for its large, showy flowers, which can be yellow, pink, or white, and have a distinctive cone-shaped seed pod in the center. Lotus plants thrive in warm weather in shallow, nutrient-rich waters, with roots anchoring in the mud and long stems connecting to the leaves and flowers. </p>

            <li>Normal flow in HTML is how the web elements are automatically laid out on the page before any positionings  </li>
            <li>Float is a tag that helps move elements to the left or right, allows other text or inline elements to warp around. I need to clear the float because when you float elements, the texts will float around the contains, so when you do not want it anymore, you clear the float.</li>
            <li>Absolute is removes the element from normal flow. Fixed stays fixed to the view port even when scrolling. Relative is to move an element relative to its normal position</li>
            <li>In order to make a nice navigation buttons for mobile devices you can make the bottons with CSS for responsiveness</li>
            <li>I can find videos from the Canvas, in the lecture notes</li>
